# DB Replicator

This script is a JavaScript tool designed to replicate a database from a source to a destination. It allows you to easily transfer data from one database to another, making it useful for backup, migration, or synchronization purposes. The script is flexible and can be customized to work with various types of databases, including SQL databases, NoSQL databases, and more.


# Important Notes

 1 ) Make sure to take appropriate backups before running this script, especially if you're replicating data to a production database. Although the script is designed to be safe and non-destructive, unexpected errors may occur during data replication.

 2 ) The script assumes that the destination tables are already created with the same schema as the source tables. If not, you might need to create the destination tables manually before running the script.
